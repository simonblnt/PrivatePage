**
* Main
**
    - should change to a one-page app structure
        - maybe 
    - should add a header with only the name of the app
    - it could contain a button, which hides/shows the main nav menu on the side
    - later it could contain the name of the user, with a dropdown menu containing the usual user options
        like settings, log out etc.
    - later it could contain a search bar with a dropdown menu -> (eg.: projects, subjects, recipies etc.)

**
* Recipies
**
    - somewhat bigger rows containing basic infos about the recipie, but they are clickable, and by doing so,
        the selected recipie will expand like an accordion menu, and show its details like a detailed list of 
        ingredients, and the detailed instructions with an image as well
    - it has the same pencil and trash icons as other "tables" have
    - it has the same add button as other pages have
    - maybe it shouldn't be a table at all, more like a menu (an accordion menu)
    - if it technically is a table, it should't really appear as one, e.g.: remove the thead

**
* Work
**
    - maybe add a timetracker later on

* Login

    DONE - fix page height

**
* Main
**
    - should change to a one-page app structure
        -> maybe it should only apply to main pages, e.g.: only one subjects page, only one work page etc.
    - need something else instead of this accordion menu on the main nav, because sometimes the user have to chase
        the menu items this way
    - !! should specify colors as variables !!

**
* Recipies
**
    - categories could be links, that redirects the user to a filtered list of recipies by that category

**
* Recipies
**
    - should add a counter to each recipie: "times cooked"/"times made" or something like that
    - could add a calorie tracker later
